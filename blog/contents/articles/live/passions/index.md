### Passion

![passion4travel](/images/passion4travel.jpg)

I have this passion to travel and I am going to make that my life.

#### It is always time or money.  

Most of my time, I either have the time or money.  The windows where I have time AND money are dimishingly small.  I want to increase this window to the point where it is the majority.

The reason that Time-or-Money (ToM) is a problem for me is because someone else has always been controlling my ToM.

During the 'recession' of 2000's, I've found myself between jobs.  This gave me the opportunity to re-exam my life.  I've found that there is a direct correllation between time and money in my life.  Most of the time, I have the money but, not the time.  From as far back as I can remember, I have been trained by school-family-society that success in life depends on how much money one has.  I've spent most of my waking hour trying to measure my success by this yard-stick.

I was happy.  The happiness of ignorance.  It is a close loop feed back system I was in.  Others around me use the same measurement stick and seemed happy.  I was happy.

After this reflection, I found that I was not happy.  I was content.  I was docile.  Life comes at me and I make the best of it.  How well I do is dictated by my stick.

With the goverment's support, I've decided to remove money from my measurement.  What I have left was time.  This is novel, this is new, I now have time to live my life.

##### What Am I to do with all this time.

My measurement stick changed and I am lost.  I found that I did not have any passion.  I have been floating through life without any other goal than to make money.  Without this goal, I am lost.

I need to become un-lost.  I need to re-define myself.  After meditations, I understand that 'I need to understand myself better before I can re-define it.'  Up to now, external drivers control my life, I decided to see if I can reverse that.  I want to see if I can ignore external drivers and live my life.

I found that I could.  Daily experiences were exhilarating.  I have no master but myself.  My time is my own to do as I like.  Day and night, I do as I please following a single rule:

- Have fun.  No drama.

I soon found that this is not enough.

##### Selfish individuals

I found that 'Have fun. No drama' produces selfish people!

Everything I do, would be guided by this rule.  If it is not fun.  I will not do it.  If it cause negative drama to myself or other, I will not do it.  I have no empathy for others.  I have become selfish.  Something is missing.

##### Rules are needed

I found that I need some guidelines to 'HFND.'  After self examinations, came up with the following rule:

> live, learn, grow

- live : don't be a wall flower.  Contribute and be involved.
- learn : reflect on the events from living and try understand them
- grow : using what I learn to make my life more possitive

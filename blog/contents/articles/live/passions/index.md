### Passion

![businessplan](/images/2bees.jpg)

I am interested in how people connect to each others.  I recently saw on Ted a talk about predictions and it got me to think about building my avatar to assist me with my online life.

2bees is about individual's social connections

I have this passion to travel and I am going to make that my life.

#### It is always time or money.  

Most of my time, I either have the time or money.  The windows where I have time AND money are dimishingly small.  I want to increase this window to the point where it is the majority.

The reason that Time-or-Money (ToM) is a problem for me is because someone else has always been controlling my ToM.

During the 'recession' of 2000's, I've found myself between jobs.  This gave me the opportunity to re-exam my life.  I've found that there is a direct correllation between time and money in my life.  Most of the time, I have the money but, not the time.  From as far back as I can remember, I have been trained by school-family-society that success in life depends on how much money one has.  I've spent most of my waking hour trying to measure my success by this yard-stick.

I was happy.  The happiness of ignorance.  It is a close loop feed back system I was in.  Others around me use the same measurement stick and seemed happy.  I was happy.

Upon reflections, I found that I was not happy.  I was content.  I was docile.  Life comes at me and I navigate it according to the measurements of my yard-stick.

I was unhappy with the way I measure my life.  Through some consequences, I was able to remove money from my measurements.  What I have left was time.  This is novel, this is new, I now have time to live my life.

##### What Am I to do with all this time.

I need to re-define myself using my new yard-stick.

I did not worry about money when I was living at home.  My parents took care of that.

I had live life according to a single rule:

- Have fun.  No drama.

##### Selfish individuals

But, I found that 'Have fun. No drama' produces selfish people!

I remember; If it is not fun.  I will not do it.  Negative drama , I will not do it.  I was selfish.  It was all about me.

##### Rules are needed

A rule for more empathy.

> live, learn, grow

- live : don't be a wall flower.  Contribute and be involved.
- learn : reflect on the events from living and try understand them
- grow : using what I learn to make my life more possitive

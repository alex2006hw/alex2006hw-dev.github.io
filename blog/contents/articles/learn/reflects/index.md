> Learning to be a Founder

![Founder](/images/stevejobs-founder.jpg)

  It all started with a need.  I need a way to easily manage my life's connections.  Preferably on my phone.

  I found that I need to be a developer so that I can build the backend API. After that, comes UI, UX, bizDev and Founder.  With all that under my belt, I feel that I am ready to build a company to build the product that I want to manage my life's connections.

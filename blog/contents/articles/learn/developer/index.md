### I have a [dream](/articles/projects/buildrobot/brain) to build an online entity (robot).



![freedom](/images/freedom.jpg)

I have been trying to find interest to help build my robot and it is impossible to get tractions.  I am building the infrastructure.  I like Javsscript so, this will be done in JS.

#### Phase I
- Online [Identity](/articles/projects/buildrobot/brain/identity) that would let my robot identify itself.
- Online asset management for longterm and shortterm memory.
- Online decision engine.

#### Phase II
- social connections

### Todo
[task list](/articles/todo) and todo

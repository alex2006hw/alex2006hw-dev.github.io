# alex2006hw.github.io - builder
-----

Personal blog and portfolio built with **Astro** and **Pagefind** for fast static site generation and search.

---

## 🚀 Use Case

This project serves as:
- A **personal blog** for publishing articles, notes, and technical reflections.
- A **resume site** with collapsible sections for interactive viewing.
- A **portfolio hub** linking to projects and references.

The site is designed to be:
- **Static** (easy to host on GitHub Pages or any CDN).
- **Searchable** (Pagefind indexes content for instant search).
- **Maintainable** (content stored in `src/content/` as Markdown).

## 📝 Creating a New Blog Post

1. **Add a Markdown file** under `src/content/posts/`:
```bash
src/content/posts/my-new-post.md
```
2. **Frontmatter format** (top of the file):
```bash
---
title: "My New Post"
author: "alex2006hw"
published: 2025-11-23
description: "A short summary of the post"
draft: false
tags: ["astro", "blog"]
category: "learning"
---
```

3. **Write your content in Markdown** below the frontmatter:
```bash
## Introduction
This is the start of my new blog post.

### Section
Add headings, lists, images, and links as needed.
```

4. **Build for production**:
```bash

## About

I’m a seasoned **Security Architect and Infrastructure Leader** with a career spanning startups, Fortune 500 companies, and government agencies — including NASA, StubHub/eBay, Virgin Mobile USA, Hotwire/Expedia, and Charles Schwab. Over the years, I’ve built and scaled secure, high-availability environments that support millions of users and mission-critical applications.

My journey started in **systems administration and programming**, where I learned the value of designing for resilience and scalability. From there, I moved into **enterprise security architecture**, leading projects that ranged from **global PCI/SOX/HIPAA compliance frameworks** to **datacenter builds and migrations** supporting explosive growth. Along the way, I’ve architected infrastructures that grew from dozens to thousands of servers, upgraded networks to 10Gb capacity, and directed worldwide audits and penetration tests.

### What Drives Me
- **Architecting secure frameworks** that meet compliance and industry standards  
- **Scaling infrastructure** to handle rapid growth without sacrificing reliability  
- **Mentoring teams** and building strong IT organizations that adapt quickly  
- **Collaborating across functions** to ensure technology empowers business outcomes  

I’ve had the privilege of working across industries — finance, telecom, e-commerce, travel, and government — and each role has reinforced my belief that **security and scalability are inseparable from innovation**. My focus today remains the same as it’s always been: designing systems that are **robust, secure, and future-proof**, while empowering the people who maintain them.

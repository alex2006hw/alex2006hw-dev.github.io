I have this passion to travel and I am going to make that my life.

#### It is always time or money.  

Most of my time, I either have the time or money.  Lately I found that the windows where I have time AND money are dimishingly small.  I need to change this.

The reason that Time-or-Money (ToM) is a problem for me is that someone else has always been controlling my ToM.

During the 'recession' of 2000's, I've found myself between jobs.  This gave me the opportunity to re-exam my life.  I've found that there is a direct correllation between time and money.  When I was working, I have the money but, not the time!  
From as far back as I can remember, I have been trained by school-family-society that success in life depends on how much money one has.  I've spent most of my waking hour trying to measure my success by this yard-stick.

Happiness of ignorance.  It is a close loop feed back system I was in.  Others around me use the same measurement stick and seemed happy.  I was happy.

I was content.  I was docile.  Life comes at me and I navigate it according to my yard-stick.

I was unhappy with the way I measure my life.  Through some consequences, I was able to remove money from my measurements.  What I have left was time.  This is novel, this is new, I now have time to live my life.

##### What Am I to do with all this time.

Having worked with Razoo, I believes in TechforGood (TfG).  Let's do something TfG.

##### Selfish individuals

Previously, I live life according to a single rule:

- Have fun.  No drama.

But, I found that 'Have fun. No drama' produces selfish people.

People who live "Having Fun" while avoiding Drama, become selfish.  All about me!

##### Change is needed

Add a rule for empathy.

> live, learn, grow

- live : don't be a wall flower.  Contribute and be involved.
- learn : reflect on the events from living and try understand them
- grow : using what I learn to make my life more possitive

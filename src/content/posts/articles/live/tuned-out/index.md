### Tuned-out

I find that it is hard to improve my social skills when everyone is so plugged-in and tuned-out.

- I look around and 'no eye-contact!' during my daily commuting.  Other than the sounds of the train, I can hear a pin drop.
-- It seems that messaging is the new mode of communication.  In a culture where my tweets is more important that what I say, speaking has less of an apeal.
